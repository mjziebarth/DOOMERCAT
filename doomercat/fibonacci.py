def fibonacci_lattice(D: float, a: float = 6378137.0):
    """
    Returns (nearly) equally spaced points with a Fibonacci lattice
    on a sphere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : float
       Average distance of points on the sphere (unit follows from unit
       of radius, default is in meter).
    a : float, optional
       Radius of the sphere. Default is the WGS84 in meter.

    Returns
    -------
    longitude: ndarray
       Longitudes of the point set in degrees.
    latitude: ndarray
       Latitudes of the point set in degrees.
