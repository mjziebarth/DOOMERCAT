	Read points from a shapefile into numpy arrays. This can
	be used to consequently optimize a Laborde oblique Mercator
	for the points in the shapefile.

	Arguments:
	   filename : String pointing to the path of the shapefile.

	Keyword arguments:
	   method   : One of 'centroids' and 'points'.
	              'centroids' : For all geometries in the
	                  shapefile, compute and use only the centroid.
	                  This is suitable for large data sets.
	              'points'    : Use all points of all geometries.
